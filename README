## What is this?

This is a library developped in order to simplify the control of a VME system used to provide a cosmic trigger to a GLIB board.

## Where can I find documentation?

### Good way

Download the whole archive and unzip it.

Install doxygen (if using a debian based system, it's in the official depots, yay!).

run "$doxygen Doxyfile" in the downloaded folder.

Go in the created "html" folder and open "index.html".

### Not so good but easier

I should host this somewhere, don't you think?
