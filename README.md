## What is this?

This is a library developped in order to simplify the control of a VME system used to provide a cosmic trigger to a GLIB board.

A quick overview of the hardware [can be found here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/33459975/cosmicTrigger/DocHardware.pdf).

## Where can I find documentation?

### Good way

Download the whole archive and unzip it.

Install doxygen (if using a debian based system, it's in the official depots, yay!).

run "$doxygen Doxyfile" in the downloaded folder.

Go in the created "html" folder and open "index.html".

### Not so good but easier

The documentation is also hosted on [a free hosting website](http://www.cosmictrigger.comeze.com).

It probably won't be updated a lot, but it's much easier to use!

## License?

Do whatever you want with it but don't blame me if something bad happens!
